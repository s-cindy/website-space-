  Since NASA technology is taxpayer funded, it is shared with the American people and by extension, the people of the world. New technologies shared in this way are called Spinoff’s and the public has benefitted from over 2,000 of them since 1976, often in the form of commercial products.  Some, such as Tang and Teflon, are widely known but many are not. Herewith is a short list of some of the more interesting and possibly surprising ways in which NASA engineering and research have become part of our lives, helping to solve some of our most pressing societal and environmental challenges.</li>
 
    <li> Lightning in a Bottle.
From 1997 to 2017, the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) looked into how long-duration spaceflight affected people, funded with grants from NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. One area of interest was light sources and how they affected brain activity. The NSBRI funded two professors, Thomas Jefferson University’s George Brainard and Harvard Medical School’s Steven Lockley, to learn more. Lockley and Brainard’s research found that exposure to excess blue light at the wrong time could throw off a person’s body. This happened because the body’s production of melatonin, a key hormone for managing circadian rhythms, was inhibited when certain wavelengths of blue light hit photoreceptors in the eyes.</li>
  
    <li>Space Age Water Conservation:The more difficult a problem is for NASA, the more solutions it eventually produces for the rest of us. Few challenges are more pressing for the space agency than the need for clean water. Water is heavy — much heavier than the liquid hydrogen and oxygen NASA uses for rocket fuel — and every pound launched into space costs thousands of dollars. So on the space station, nothing is wasted — sweat, urine, and even breath moisture are collected, purified, and recycled as drinking water. But despite its origins, the water astronauts drink is cleaner than what’s available to most people on Earth.</li>
